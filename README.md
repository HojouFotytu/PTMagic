# Profit Trailer Magic
Profit Trailer Magic is a **FREE** open source and the most complete all-in-one addon for the cryptocurrency trading bot Profit Trailer.  It was originally created in February 2018 by Christian KÃ¼hl (Legedric), with a robust development cycle that ended on June 7th, when he decided to make the project open-source.  He always exemplified the standards found in the Code of Conduct posted in the orginal repository.  https://github.com/Legedric  Those of us following his lead and continuing to develop PTMagic have made a clone of the project here in December 2018, in order to more easily access and administer the project.

### Feature Highlights:
- Define multiple Profit Trailer **Global Settings** and use the Profit Trailer API to modify the currently active PAIRS/DCA/INDICATORS settings in real time, to adjust your settings for ALL COINS, according to changing market conditions.

- Define multiple Profit Trailer **Single Market Settings** and use the Profit Trailer API to modify the currently active PAIRS/DCA/INDICATORS settings in real time, to modify any coin-specific settings automatically based on their individual behavior.  

- By combining the **Global Settings** and **Single Market Settings** PTMagic creates a dynamic trading strategy that automatically changes how Profit Trailer trades, to ensure more protection and versatility than any single strategy can provide, without constant supervision and intervention.
