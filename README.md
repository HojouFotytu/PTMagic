# Profit Trailer Magic
Profit Trailer Magic is a **FREE** open source and the most complete all-in-one addon for the cryptocurrency trading bot Profit Trailer.  It was originally created in February 2018 by Christian KÃ¼hl (Legedric), with a robust development cycle that ended on June 7th, when he decided to make the project open-source.  He always exemplified the standards found in the Code of Conduct posted in the orginal repository.  https://github.com/Legedric  Those of us following his lead and continuing to develop PTMagic have made a clone of the project here in December 2018, in order to more easily access and administer the project.

### Feature Highlights:
- Define multiple Profit Trailer **Global Settings** and use the Profit Trailer API to automatically modify the currently active PAIRS/DCA/INDICATORS settings in real time, according to changing market conditions.

- Define multiple Profit Trailer **Single Market Settings** and use the Profit Trailer API to automatically modify any coin-specific settings in real-time, based on their individual behavior.  

- By combining the **Global Settings** and **Single Market Settings** PTMagic allows you to create a robust and dynamic trading strategy to ensure more protection and versatility than any single strategy can provide -- without constant supervision and intervention.

- **Watch what your bot is thinking in real time**, with a simple GUI interface showing the status of current buy strategies in your possible buy list, as well as the current status of your sell strategies for all the coins you currently hold.

- See a simple representations of **current market conditions**, as well as the current trends in various timeframes, for every coin on your exchange.

- A **complete sales history and analysis** including a list of your best performing coins, as well as projections for the next year based on your past performance.

- A **bag analyzer** showing detailed buy and sell data for coins you currently hold, including an embeded trading view chart for each coin.

- An **automated DCA calcuulator** that reads your current Profit Trailer settings, and generates a more accurate view of projected DCA costs using actual coin costs and your current DCA buy triggers and buy percentages.
